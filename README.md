Introduction
Skin-Cancer-Classification is a project focused on developing a machine learning model for classifying skin cancer types from images of skin lesions. This project utilizes advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to identify and differentiate between benign and malignant skin conditions, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and treatment. It provides a comprehensive solution for researchers and healthcare professionals to enhance skin cancer detection and improve patient outcomes.

Features
Image Classification: Uses deep learning models to classify skin lesions into different categories, such as benign or malignant, based on visual characteristics.
Pre-Trained Models: Includes pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets of skin images to provide accurate classification results.
Customizable Training: Allows for fine-tuning and retraining of models on specific datasets to adapt to different skin cancer types or regional variations.
Data Augmentation: Implements techniques for augmenting training data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to improve model robustness and generalization.
Performance Metrics: Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance and reliability.
User-Friendly Interface: Features an intuitive interface for uploading images, running classifications, and viewing results.
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed guides and examples for setting up the classification model, training, and deploying the solution in clinical or research settings.
